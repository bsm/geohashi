## Precision

This library allows you to select the precision of the hash you want to create, up to a maximum of 26 bits.

The following table shows the maximum uncertainty (at the equator) for a given bit-precision:

|Bits| Uncertainty |
|----|-------------|
| 26 | ±0.35m      |
| 25 | ±0.65m      |
| 24 | ±1.3m       |
| 23 | ±2.6m       |
| 22 | ±5.3m       |
| 21 | ±11m        |
| 20 | ±21m        |
| 19 | ±42m        |
| 18 | ±84m        |
| 17 | ±170m       |
